## What is this?
This website is a clone of the popular music streaming platform Spotify. It was created as part of my learning project to learn how to use the Spotify API. The website features all of the same basic functionalities as Spotify. I created this website to showcase my skills in web development and API integration. It will be included in my portfolio as an example of my work.
